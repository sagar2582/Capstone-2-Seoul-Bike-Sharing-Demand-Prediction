# Capstone-2-Seoul-Bike-Sharing-Demand-Prediction
The objective of this work is to predict the trip duration of rental bikes in the Seoul Bike sharing system. The data used include weather information (Temperature, Humidity, Windspeed, Visibility, Dewpoint, Solar radiation, Snowfall, Rainfall), the number of bikes rented per hour and date information.

Feature engineering is done to extract additional features from the data. Four statistical models are used to predict the trip duration. (a) Linear regression (b) Decision Tree (c) Random Forest (RF). (d) Gradient boosting machines (e) Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
